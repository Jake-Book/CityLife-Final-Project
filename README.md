All data collected for this assignment determined certain variables for that data that was collected. Starting off there needed to be a unit of analysis for this assignment, which was “City.”	 For the population used in this assignment I used all the cities that were collected for data. To collect these sample cities, I chose the ones that were the most convenient since the sample size was a total of 118. The sample size would be the total amount of population that was used in the data, as explained just now, the sample size was 118.
In this data that I collected using the variables from specific known cities in the U.S. I determined the average crime rate in those cities based on their wealth. These two both being the main important factors, or known as the quantitative variables. I needed to determine the summary statistics so I would describe the distribution of the variable. By using the data collected I determined that the mean with the gross domestic product to be 0.71484.06 with a standard deviation of 22611.13 to split between the minimum and maximum of 31369 and 210235. Looking at the average crime rate, I determined that 0.414758 percent of the summary statistical analysis with a standard deviation of 0.1923259 to split the minimum and maximum of 0.05 and 0.98. Moving onto the qualitative data I used simple things in a city based on a yes or no answer to it, using topics like landlocked, if the city had an NFL football team, and if the poverty rate was over 10. For the qualitative analysis I just needed to determine the summary statistical analysis, by dividing both the amount of yes/no answers by the sample size given, which was 118.
